o Currently, it is a one-person team behind all of this. My name is Ethan Joyner (Sophomore), and I fully understand that this project will not be something that I can single-handedly accomplish. So, if you have any skills that you think you can bring to the table, all are welcome from individuals, clubs, fraternities, and sororities. Send an email with “WFMSU-SUPPORT” in the title. Thank you.
